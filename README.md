# Augmented-Reality-Fingerprint-Registration-Concept

Fingerprint e-ink imprint system concept. Touch the e-ink suface once and the fingerprint is saved, then remove the finger and wait for the electronic card to scan it.
This is a concept design on a single ID device to provide an alternative to holding multiple cards. The device gives information on an individual, as well as handle banking authentication using a fingerprint imprint reader, while also providing an expanded view of information using augmented reality.
